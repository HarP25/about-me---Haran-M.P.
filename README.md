# Hi, I’m Haran 👋

I’m a 13-year-old student from India who enjoys learning computer science,
machine learning, and problem-solving.

### What I’m working on
- Machine learning projects (classification, ROC-AUC, feature engineering)
- Kaggle competitions and experiments
- Python, LightGBM, XGBoost, and basic deep learning

### What I believe
- Learning by building
- Understanding before optimizing
- Progress over perfection

### Current achievements
- Learning PyTorch and deep learning fundamentals
- Improving feature engineering skills
- Writing cleaner, more readable code

📫 I use GitHub as a learning journal, not just a portfolio.

> I don’t aim to be perfect, but I want to be better than yesterday.

### Interests
- Computer science and machine learning
- Understanding how technology creates real-world value
- Learning the basics of entrepreneurship and product thinking

### What I’m learning
- Building strong CS and ML fundamentals, with basics of robotics
- Thinking about problems from a user and business perspective
- Improving decision-making and long-term planning
